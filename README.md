## Overview

In today’s world, understanding cities requires more than just traditional methods. Urban planners and social scientists are increasingly turning to data science techniques to gain deeper insights into the complex issues that cities face. This course serves as an introduction to data science for undergraduate and graduate students in urban planning and related fields.

Throughout this course, you will delve into the interdisciplinary field of data science, which combines scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract valuable insights from diverse datasets. We will explore how data from various sectors, such as transportation, housing, and the physical environment, can be analyzed to understand urban dynamics better.

You will develop a solid foundation in key data science concepts and techniques using the programming language Python. We will begin by covering essential topics such as data import, cleansing, and transformation, laying the groundwork for more advanced analyses. As we progress, we will introduce data visualization techniques tailored to the needs of urban planners, emphasizing effective communication of findings and insights.

By the end of this course, you will have acquired fundamental skills and tools essential for conducting data-driven analyses in urban planning. Whether you're an undergraduate embarking on your academic journey or a graduate student preparing for advanced research, this course will provide you with the necessary expertise to tackle real-world urban challenges. Moreover, the knowledge gained here will serve as a solid foundation for future coursework and research endeavors, empowering you to confidently apply data science techniques to your capstone, thesis, or dissertation work.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the fundamental concepts, theories, and models of urban data analytics.
2. Collect, import, tidy, export, and manipulate data effectively and efficiently.
3. Have the necessary quantitative, GIS, and Python programming skills for analyzing urban issues and problems through a series of hands-on lab exercises.
4. Identify urban problems/research questions and solve them in a reproducible way using spatial analysis/visualization techniques through final projects.
5. Engage in hands-on projects and case studies that apply data science techniques to real-world urban challenges, fostering problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should provide documentation to the Access Disabled Assistance Program for Tech Students (http://www.adapts.gatech.edu/) and bring an ADAPTS accommodation letter to the instructor indicating the nature of accommodations required. This should be done within the first week of class or as soon as possible after a new disability condition arises. All efforts will be made to provide reasonable accommodations.

## Evaluation

The course will be structured as a combined lecture-lab course. You are expected to have read all assigned readings ahead of time and be prepared to participate actively in class discussions. Students will be evaluated on three sets of tasks:

- Three lab assignments (15 pts total, 5 pts each):
Through completing three lab assignments, students will gain first-hand knowledge of the use and operation of Python in urban data science challenges.

- Hackathon challenge (30 pts total):
The hackathon leverages open datasets and advanced analytics to address critical issues. Teams will use data visualization, machine learning, and geospatial analysis to develop actionable solutions, presenting their insights to the class.

- Final Project (50 pts total: 20 pts on Presentation, 30 pts on Final project paper):
The final class requirement is a team-based project that applies the knowledge learned in the class to a real-world problem. Fifteen percent of the total course grade will be a formal presentation to the class.

- Class participation (5 pts):


All assignments (unless otherwise noted) are to be submitted through the “Assignments” tab on Canvas. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that assignments submitted through Canvas are successfully uploaded into the system on time. For late submissions to any of the assignments above (final project paper excluded), a .5 point/day penalty will be applied. Late project paper submissions are not accepted. In the case of illness or other special circumstances, notification should be given as soon as possible and before the assignment deadline.
