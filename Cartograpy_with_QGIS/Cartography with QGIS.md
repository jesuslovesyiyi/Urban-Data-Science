# Cartography with QGIS :qgis:

Author: Tara Liu & Yiyi He

> QGIS (formerly Quantum GIS) is an *open-source* Geographic Information System (GIS) software that allows users to view, analyze, and edit spatial data. It provides a platform for creating maps, performing geospatial analysis, and managing various types of geographic information. QGIS is widely used for mapping and spatial analysis tasks, and it is accessible to a diverse user community due to its open-source nature.

## Open QGIS  👐 :qgis:

1. Open QGIS (Windows: Start > QGIS Desktop / MacOS: Applications > QGIS.app ). This might take a few seconds to load and open or you can open the QGIS folder on your desktop. In this folder, find QGIS Desktop and double-click it to open this program.
    - If it is your first time opening QGIS, you will need to get through some messages/hints by clicking next.
2. Navigate QGIS by familiarizing yourself with the various parts of the QGIS browser, hover your mouse over icons to view names of various tools.

**Note:** Your browser may have different tools than the image below.

- *Layers pane*l - This is where layers (i.e. imagery, building layers) will be listed. The order of layers in the panel impacts the order of layers in the map - in other words, the layer at the top of the list will appear as the top layer in the map.
- *Toolbars* - Most of the tools you will regularly use in QGIS will appear as icons in the toolbars at the top, such as save, zoom, pan. The number of toolbars depends on various features you have activated or installed.
- *Map Canvas* - When layers are added to the Layers Panel, they will appear in the map canvas.
- *Menu Bar* - Provides access to QGIS functions using standard hierarchical menus.
- *Status Bar* - Coordinates, scale, and projection will appear in the Status Bar.

**Note:** This [**QGIS graphic user interface (GUI)**](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html) document explains all the tools that are found on the interface you see when you first open QGIS.

## Creating a new Project and Saving 🆕 💾

- Open the Menu bar, and select **‘Project’ > ‘New’ .**
- On the Menu bar, select **‘Project’ > ‘Save As’**.
- Select the folder that you want to save your project in (ideally this will be the folder that you saved your shapefile datasets in.
- Select a name for your QGIS project, for example, ‘virginia_railway_system’, and select “**Save**”.
- Your project will be saved as a ‘**.qgz**’ file.
- From here on out, you can click ‘*Save*’ and your project will be saved.

**Note:** you are advised to save your project after every 10 minutes of working to prevent losing your data in case your project crashes.

## Adding Data to QGIS ➕📔

Since the canvas that first opens on QGIS is blank, you are advised to add a basemap (raster data) before adding any other data. This helps you to reference and check that the vector data that will be added are falling on the right coordinates on the map.

**1. Adding a Basemap (raster data)**

Before adding a basemap, you will need to install the plugin—this allows you to extend the functionality of QGIS—that will give you access to different free, online basemaps to add to your QGIS maps. This plugin is known as **QuickMapServices**.

**Note:** Managing and installing plugins requires an internet connection. If the Plugin Manager is not working, check your internet connection. Also, as QuickMapServices provides online basemaps, use of these layers requires a consistent internet connection.

To install this plugin, follow these steps:

- Click on the menu item Plugins **‣** Manage and Install Plugins

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/plugins.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/plugins.PNG)

- In the Plugin Manager dialog box that opens, click on the search bar and type ‘**QuickMapServices**’, the plugin will appear in the list.
- Then click the ‘**Install Plugin**’ button.

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/QMS.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/QMS.PNG)

- Once installed, QuickMapServices can be accessed on the Menu Bar. Select Web **‣** QuickMapServices
- For more basemaps, including aerial imagery, in the QuickMapServices sub-menu, open ‘**Settings**’. Click the ‘**More Services**’ tab. Select ‘**Get Contributed Pack**’.

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/QMS2.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/QMS2.PNG)

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/QMS3.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/QMS3.PNG)

- Return to the QuickMapServices sub-menu. There will now be a long list of options for basemaps, including Bing.

In this exercise, we will use OpenStreetMap as our basemap (raster) layer.

- Go to the ‘Menu Bar’, select **Web ‣ QuickMapServices ‣ OSM ‣ OSM Standard**
- A basemap of the world will open and OSM Standard will be added to your layer panel as a rasterdata layer.

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/OSMRaster.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/OSMRaster.PNG)

**2. Adding vector data**

- Hover your mouse over the tools until you find the “**Add Vector Layer**” tool. Click on this icon to open the Add Vector Data dialog.
    
    ![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/addvector.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/addvector.PNG)
    

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/addvectorlayer.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/addvectorlayer.PNG)

- Click the 3 dots under ‘**Source**’ and navigate to the location on your computer where you saved the geojson that you downloaded and click ‘**Open**’ (you can select all four layers at once).
    
    ![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/dots.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/dots.PNG)
    

![image.png](img/image%201.png)

- Then click “**Add**”
- When the data source and project have different CRS, you may be prompted to choose the destination CRS.

![image.png](img/image%202.png)

- The following data will be added:
    - Georgia_Counties

![image.png](img/image%203.png)

**Note:** the color of datasets on the Map Canvas might differ from what you see on the image above.

- Zoom in and out of your map using the scroll button on your mouse, using two fingers on your touchpad, or right clicking and holding down.
- Drag the layers up or down so that they do not cover each other.
- You can turn layers on and off by checking/unchecking the box next to each name.

**Note:** Clicking the menus at the top of the screen will show various tools you can use to edit, visualize and analyze your data.

**Exploring the Attribute Table**

- Right-click on each layer and select “**Open Attribute Table**”. A new window will open that shows the attribute table of the selected layer.

![image.png](Cartography%20with%20QGIS%20qgis%20189140d41d12802f8b0ed0c456da2ba8/image%204.png)

- Every point, line, or polygon file has an attribute table.

![image.png](Cartography%20with%20QGIS%20qgis%20189140d41d12802f8b0ed0c456da2ba8/image%205.png)

- Any data in the attribute table can be used for displaying and labeling on the map and making queries.
- You can also create new columns in the table and add data or calculations.
- Metadata can be key to understanding attribute tables that use codes and abbreviations.

<aside>
💡

**Note:** you cannot open an attribute table for a raster data layer because this format represents information as a grid of cells where each cell contains a value representing a certain attribute. Rasters don't have attribute tables in the same way that vector data does.

## Symbolizing your Map

Data can be symbolized in a variety of ways, depending on the data format and available attributes.

**Changing a Single Symbol**

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/symbolqgis.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/symbolqgis.PNG)

1. Right click on the point layer for “Virginia_Passenger_Rail_Stations” and scroll to the bottom to select ‘**Properties**’.
2. A new layer will open (Layer Properties), select “**Symbology**”
3. You can choose any symbol and color that you think best represents train stations (scroll if needed)
    - You can make more modifications to the symbol and get additional symbol styles by selecting “**Simple Marker**”.
    - Click the dropdown button under ‘Symbol layer type’ and select SVG Marker. This offers you a more versatile and flexible way to represent point features on your map with custom graphics.
    - Scroll down on the ‘SVG Groups’, select ‘transport’ and choose the marker that will best represent a train station from the ‘SVG Images’.

**Note:**

you can also use the search button

![https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/search.PNG](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/363383/images/search.PNG)

to search for a specific marker.

- Change the color, size, stroke, etc. for your points until you get a symbol that you think will best represent your layer.
- When you are satisfied with your symbol, click ‘Apply’ then ‘OK’ .

**Symbolize Categories**

Let us change the color and categorize the counties’ data according to their names:

1. Open the ‘Properties’ of the “Georgia_Counties” layer.
2. Select the dropdown button under ‘Single Symbol’ and select “**Categorized**”.
3. Under ‘Value’ select “Sq_Miles”, choose a color ramp, and click “**Classify**”.

# Create a Layout of Your Map 🔎

In this section, you are going to create your map that will be exported to become a basemap. A basemap is like a background picture on a map that helps you know where things are. It shows features like roads, rivers, and landmarks, so you can add your information on top of it, like markers or points of interest.

1. On the Menu bar, click ‘Project’ and select “**New Print Layout**”.
2. A small pane will appear where you will enter the title of your layout and a new layout Window will open.

![image.png](Cartography%20with%20QGIS%20qgis%20189140d41d12802f8b0ed0c456da2ba8/image%2010.png)

1. On the left panel, click the “**Add Map**” icon and draw a box where you would like the map to be placed

💡

## **TODALS: 6 basic elements of “a good” map**

**T = Title:** Gives the reader a basic preview of what the map is displaying or its purpose.

**O = Orientation:** Which way is north!? (so reader can figure out how to hold map)

**D = Date:** When was it created? (is this current, outdated, historic?)

**A = Author:** Who created/made/owns the map? (& is it a reliable source?)

**L = Legend/Key:** basic symbols/colors/etc are explained to the reader for clarity

**S = Scale:** shows the reader how much distance is covered on a map about real world
